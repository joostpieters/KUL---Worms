OGPProject
==========

Project voor het vak: Objectgericht Programmeren in JAVA.

This project is linked directly to my eclipse workspace, so changes will be updated quite fast and regularly.
Any questions about this project are to be redirected to the following address:

kristof.achten@student.kuleuven.be

Other than that, I'm still looking for testers. Feel free to download the sourcefiles, import it as a project in
eclipse and run it. All bugs are to be emailed or reported via the feature on github. Another possibility is reporting
them via my bugtracker:

Thanks.
