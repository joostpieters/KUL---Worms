**********************************
CURRENT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
**********************************

- HP set to 0 on start without falling too high or doing something really weird (Probably a problem with setMass an calcMass, so check them too)
- Shooting isn't working, nullpointerexception because world probably isn't set correctly for this projectile.
- Fall doesn't work correctly.
- Worms and food aren't spawning on isAdjacent certified locations!

***********
FIXED BUGS
***********

- Food is spawning, unfortunately not in the right position.
- Stability issues fixed.
- Better isAdjacent search algorithm.
- Food is now removed when overlapping with a worm.
- Worms are being removed when HP <= 0;
- World setting fixed.
