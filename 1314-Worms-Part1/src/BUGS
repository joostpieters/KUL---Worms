**********************************
CURRENT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
**********************************

- HP set to 0 without falling too high or doing something really weird (Probably a problem with setMass an calcMass, so check them too)
- Shooting isn't working, nullpointerexception because world probably isn't set correctly for this projectile.
- Check world-setting in general.
- Worms aren't removed even though HP is set to 0.
- Fall doesn't work correctly.
